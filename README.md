# Ultrasonic_mapping
Mapping surroundings using ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor. 
This project was compiled for LV 2012. For it to work, you must install Arduino LIFA (from vi package manager). 
Also serial drivers for labview might be needed.
As of now servo is rotating in 180 degrees range. It wasn't tested for 360, but it should also work.
